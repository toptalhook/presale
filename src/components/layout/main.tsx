                        adopted an innovative "recharge is fundraising" model, where all users participating in the

                        Our game is similar to traditional games like Pok√©mon, but it incorporates blockchain technology and
                        token economics. The strength of our project lies in its community-based foundation, where we make
                        players the core participants in the development and operation of the game. This approach allows us
                        to attract a larger and more enduring player base.
